    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My level of experience is that I am still in highschool, working to improve my skill set in overall computer knowledge, programing HTML and CSS, as well as general knowledge on word, PowerPoint and excel. I am working toward expanding my experience in this career, acquiring a job in which I will use these skill sets. My personal goals are to build trust and partnership with others, to improve my personal knowledge and acquire a stable source income. By expanding my skills early on in life, as well as acquiring experience in the workplace, I plan to achieve my goals. I am also working toward meeting new people, building trust with others, and meeting others who have more experience in this career. The values in which I consider necessary for my success are patience, resilience, and motivation to work toward my goals. As well as interest in learning other skills, even if they are not within my interests. Some short-term goals that I hope to accomplish are to learn about digital art and styling, which will help with my understanding of CSS styling on websites, also find a college which has a good reputation of programming classes and start listing jobs that will provide me with experience and a part-time source income to pay for my studies. Some character traits that I want to acquire or represent me as a person are patience, easy-going or calm, resilient, and trustworthy. I want to achieve a good diploma, be recognized for researching or developing an application or a new discovery in the future, or being able to achieve my goals. </p>
